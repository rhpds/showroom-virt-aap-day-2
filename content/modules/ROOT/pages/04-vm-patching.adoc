= VM Patching using Ansible Automation Platform

xref:03-vm-management.adoc[← Previous Exercise] | xref:05-vm-hot-add.adoc[Next Exercise →]

== Lab Overview

In this lab exercise, you will focus on updating only the security-related
packages of the provided RHEL systems using the `ansible.builtin.dnf` module.
This exercise will target all the VMs listed in your existing `OpenShift Virtual
Machines` dynamic inventory and will be added to the `tasks` directory in a file
named `update_security_packages.yml` within your `redhatone.vm_management.vm_management`
role.

The following steps will guide you in creating the `update_security_packages.yml` file
and the corresponding Ansible Playbook that will be called within your `Patch
VMs` Job Template.

NOTE: To ensure the virtual machines can access the required repositories for patch updates, the environment is configured to use the `redhatone.vm_management.rhsm_subscription` role for managing subscriptions. Additionally, a `Vault Credential` was created within Ansible Automation Platform to securely handle credentials during the automation process. These configurations have already been created for you and require no additional setup.

=== Create the `update_security_packages.yml` file.

. Within your VSCode editor, right click `tasks` of the `vm_management` collection and create a New File labeled `update_security_packages.yml`
+

+
. Add the following content to the `update_security_packages.yml`
+
----
---
- name: Update security-related packages on all hosts
  ansible.builtin.dnf:
    name: "*"
    security: true
    state: latest
----
+
. Within your `virt-aap-day2` directory, create an Ansible Playbook labeled `patch_vm_playbook.yml` with the following details:
+
----
---
- name: Patch Virtual Machines
  hosts: all
  roles:
    - redhatone.vm_management.rhsm_subscription
    - redhatone.vm_management.vm_management
----
+
. After making and saving the changes, ensure you commit and push them to your Gitea repository. For detailed instructions, refer to xref:appendix-vscode-commit-push.adoc[].
+
. Re-sync the `Workshop Project` with your latest updates within the Ansible Automation Platform UI
+
** Navigate to Automation Execution → Projects and select `Workshop Project`
+
** On the top right, select the `Sync Project` button and wait for `Last job status` to provide the status of `Success`.

=== Create & Run Update Security Packages Job Template with Ansible Automation Platform

To execute the `patch_vm_playbook.yml` within Ansible Automation Platform, create a Job Template as follows:

. Navigate to Automation Execution → Templates, click the **Create template** button, and choose **Create job template**.
+
. Fill out the following details:
+
|===
| Parameter               | Value

| Name                    | Patch VMs
| Job Type                | Run
| Inventory               | OpenShift Virtual Machines
| Project                 | Workshop Project
| Playbook                | `patch_vm_playbook.yml`
| Execution Environment   | Day2 EE
| Credentials             | Workshop Credential, Vault Credential
| Extra variables         | `task_file: update_security_packages.yml`
| Enabled Options         | Privilege Escalation

|===
+
. Click **Create job template**.
+
. Once the **Patch VMs** Job Template is created, select the **Launch Template** button on the top right corner to run the job.
+
. Once the **Patch VMs** Job is complete, you should see output similar to:
+
image::patch_vm.png[title='Patch VM', link=self, window=blank]
+
This gives a breakdown of all the taks that ran and a play recap of the changes
made to the different hosts. If you take a closer look at the Update
security-related packages on all hosts task, you can drill into specific host
details on what was installed on the system(s).

== Conclusion

Well done completing the lab!

You've now learned how to automate the patching of security-related packages on
RHEL systems using Ansible Automation Platform. By creating and integrating the
`update_security_packages.yml` task file and `patch_vm_playbook.yml`, you gained
practical experience in targeting OpenShift virtual machines for security
updates.

You should now have a clear understanding of:

* Creating and managing Ansible roles to automate security updates.
* Developing a playbook to execute tasks using a modular role structure.
* Synchronizing updates with Gitea and integrating them into Ansible Automation Platform.
* Automating the patching process through a Job Template.

These skills provide a foundation for maintaining secure and consistent
infrastructure at scale. Great job, and continue exploring automation to enhance
operational efficiency!
