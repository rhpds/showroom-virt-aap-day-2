= Hot-Plugging CPU and Memory Resources Using Ansible Automation Platform

== Lab Overview

In this lab, you will learn how to hot-plug CPU and memory resources into a
running Virtual Machine (VM) using Ansible Automation Platform and the
`redhat.openshift_virtualization` collection.

Hot-plugging is the ability to add or remove hardware resources, such as CPU or
memory, to a running VM without requiring a reboot. This capability is critical
for dynamic workloads, allowing you to scale resources based on demand while
minimizing downtime.

This lab focuses on using *instance types*, which are reusable objects in
OpenShift Virtualization that define the resources and characteristics for VMs.
Instance types simplify resource management by enabling consistent
configurations across VMs.

== What Are Instance Types?

An instance type is a reusable configuration object where you define resources
(like CPU and memory) and characteristics for new VMs. OpenShift Virtualization
provides two types of instance types:

. *VirtualMachineInstancetype*: A namespaced object for instance types limited to a specific namespace.
. *VirtualMachineClusterInstancetype*: A cluster-wide object for instance types available across all namespaces.

Both types share the same `VirtualMachineInstancetypeSpec`, allowing you to
define custom configurations or use the variety of instance types included by
default when OpenShift Virtualization is installed.

By using instance types, you can simplify VM configuration management and
ensure consistency, making them the *recommended approach* for hot-plugging
resources.

In this lab, you will primarily focus on using the instance type method while
also learning about the legacy approach of directly modifying the VM
specification for context.

NOTE: Legacy method only works when creating VMs that do not use an Instance Type.

== How to Identify if a VM Uses Instance Types or Not?

To determine whether a VM is created with an instance type or not, follow these
steps:

. Navigate to the *Overview* tab of the VM in the OpenShift Virtualization dashboard.
. In the *Details* section, look for the following:
   - *Instance Type*: If the VM uses an instance type, this field will display the name of the instance type applied to the VM.
   - *Template*: If no instance type is used, this field will display either `None` or the name of the template used to create the VM.

You can use these visual cues to identify whether the VM relies on an instance
type or a traditional template.

Below is an example image illustrating both scenarios:

* One VM shows an assigned instance type.
+
* Another VM indicates `None` under the template field, meaning no instance type is applied.

== Create the `hot_plug.yml` File

. Navigate to the Tasks Folder:
+
----
cd collections/ansible_collections/redhatone/vm_management/roles/vm_management/tasks/
----
+
. Create the `hot_plug.yml` File:
+
----
touch hot_plug.yml
----
+
. Open the `hot_plug.yml` File in Your Favorite Editor and Add the Following Tasks:

=== Using the `instance_type` (Recommended)

The `instance_type` method is the recommended approach for hot-plugging
resources into a VM. It ensures consistent and reusable resource configurations
across multiple VMs while leveraging the powerful features of OpenShift
Virtualization.

----
- name: Swap Instance Type to add more Resources
  redhat.openshift_virtualization.kubevirt_vm:
    name: "rhel9-vm1"
    namespace: "{{ vm_namespace }}"
    state: present
    instancetype:
      name: "{{ instance_type }}"
      revisionName: ""
----


**Explanation of the Task:**

- *redhat.openshift_virtualization.kubevirt_vm*: Specifies the module used to manage VMs in OpenShift Virtualization.
- *name*: The name of the VM to which the new resources will be applied.
- *namespace*: The namespace in which the VM resides.
- *state*: Ensures the VM is present and available.
- *instancetype*: Defines the instance type for the VM, allowing you to use pre-configured or custom resource settings.
  - *name*: The name of the instance type to be applied.
  - *revisionName*: Optionally specifies the exact revision of the instance type, ensuring compatibility with the VM. Typically auto-generated, thus left empty.

WARNING: VMs must be created using Instance Types for this task method to work. Otherwise use Legacy method.

=== Legacy Method: Modifying the Resources via Spec

The legacy method involves directly modifying the VM's `spec` file to update
CPU and memory resources. While this approach is flexible, it lacks the
reusability and consistency offered by instance types, making it less ideal for
managing resources across multiple VMs.


[source, yaml]
----
- name: Modify CPU & Memory Resources
  redhat.openshift_virtualization.kubevirt_vm:
    name: "rhel9-vm2"
    namespace: "{{ vm_namespace }}"
    state: present
    spec:
      domain:
        cpu:
          sockets: 2
        memory:
          guest: 4Gi
----

**Explanation of the Task:**

- *redhat.openshift_virtualization.kubevirt_vm*: Specifies the module used to manage VMs in OpenShift Virtualization.
- *name*: The name of the VM being modified.
- *namespace*: The namespace in which the VM resides.
- *state*: Ensures the VM is in the desired state, in this case, `present`.
- *spec*: Directly modifies the VM's specification.
  - *domain*: Contains settings related to the VM's virtualized environment.
    - *cpu*: Specifies the number of CPU sockets for the VM (e.g., `2`).
    - *memory*: Defines the memory allocated to the VM, (e.g., `4Gi`).

WARNING: Non-Legacy VMs are not part of this lab exercise and the Legacy Method is for informational purposes only.

== Create and Run the Hot-Plug Job Template
. Navigate to *Automation Execution → Templates*.
. Click *Create Template* and select *Create job template*.
. Fill in the following details:

[cols="2,3",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Value
| *Name* | Hot Plug VMs
| *Job Type* | Run
| *Inventory* | OpenShift Virtual Machines
| *Project* | Workshop Project
| *Playbook* | manage_vm_playbook.yml

== Conclusion

This lab has demonstrated how to effectively hot-plug CPU and memory resources
into a running Virtual Machine (VM) using Ansible Automation Platform and the
`redhat.openshift_virtualization` collection. By leveraging the recommended
*instance type* method, you can ensure consistent, reusable, and scalable
configurations across multiple VMs, simplifying resource management and aligning
with best practices.

We also explored the legacy approach of directly modifying the VM specification,
which, while flexible, is less ideal for modern environments due to its lack of
reusability and standardization. Understanding both methods equips you with the
knowledge to handle scenarios where instance types may not be available.

Through this lab, you have learned how to:
- Identify whether a VM uses an instance type or a template.
- Use the *instance type* method to dynamically add resources to VMs.
- Understand the limitations and applications of the legacy method.

By applying these skills, you can efficiently manage resources in OpenShift
Virtualization, adapting to the demands of dynamic workloads while minimizing
downtime.
