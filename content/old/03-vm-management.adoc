= VM Management with Ansible Automation Platform and Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization


== Lab Overview
In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to manage the lifecycle of your virtual
machines (VMs) using Ansible and the Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization
collection. You will focus on essential VM operations, including starting,
stopping, and restarting virtual machines.

By the end of this lab, you will have the foundational skills to apply these
techniques in your own environments, setting the stage for broader automation
initiatives. These include tasks like performing system updates and optimizing
resource utilization, which will be explored in subsequent exercises.

=== Update the `tasks/main.yml` file

Before you begin, you'll work with a `redhatone.vm_management` collection stored
in your Gitea `virt-aap-day2` repository. This collection includes a
`vm_management` role, which you will use to create tasks for starting, stopping,
and restarting a virtual machine.

Before creating these tasks, you will update the `main.yml` file within the
`vm_management` role to invoke the appropriate task based on the action value
defined in the Ansible playbook that you will create later. This setup allows a
single playbook to handle all three VM management tasks dynamically, depending
on the specified action.

. Within your link:{codeserver_url}[VSCode^] editor, navigate to the `virt-aap-day2/collections/ansible_collections/redhatone/vm_management/roles/vm_management/tasks/`
+
. Edit the following content to the `main.yml` file
+
----
---
# tasks file for vm_management

- name: Run the specific vm_management task
  include_tasks: "{{ task_file }}"
----
+
. After making and saving the changes, ensure you commit and push them to your Gitea repository. For detailed instructions, refer to xref:appendix-vscode-commit-push.adoc[].


=== Create the Ansible VM Management Playbook

This Ansible playbook dynamically calls the role and executes the appropriate
task based on the `task_file` variable given.

. Within your VSCode editor, right click `virt-aap-day2`  and create a New File labeled `manage_vm_playbook.yml`
+
. Add the following content to the `manage_vm_playbook.yml`
+
----
---
- name: Manage a Virtual Machine
  hosts: localhost
  roles:
    - redhatone.vm_management.vm_management
----
+
. After making and saving the changes, ensure you commit and push them to your Gitea repository. For detailed instructions, refer to xref:appendix-vscode-commit-push.adoc[].

=== Stop a VM Task

Create a task to wait until a virtual machine (VM) is stopped. This task will be
included in the `vm_management` role, specifically under the `tasks` directory,
in a file named `stop_vm.yml`. Later in the lab, you will call this task from an
Ansible playbook to demonstrate its capability.

. Within your VSCode editor, right click `tasks` of the `vm_management` collection and create a New File labeled `stop_vm.yml`
+
image::new_file.png[title='New File Creation', link=self, window=blank]
+
. Add the following content to the `stop_vm.yml`
+
----
---
- name: Wait until the VirtualMachine is stopped
  redhat.openshift_virtualization.kubevirt_vm:
    name: "{{ vm_name }}"
    namespace: "{{ vm_namespace }}"
    run_strategy: Halted
    wait: true
----
+
Explanation of the Task:
+
  * The `kubevirt_vm` module that is part of the `redhat.openshift_virtualization` collection is used to modify a VM
  * The `name` parameter uses a user defined variable named `vm_name` to specify which VM to stop
  * The `run_strategy: Halted` ensures the VM is not running
  * The `wait: true` ensures the next Ansible task isn't triggered until the stop is complete
+
. After making and saving the changes, ensure you commit and push them to your Gitea repository. For detailed instructions, refer to xref:appendix-vscode-commit-push.adoc[].

=== Create & Run a Job Template with Ansible Automation Platform

In order to run the `manage_vm_playbook.yml` within Ansible Automation Platform,
create a Job Template to run the automation as follows:

. Login to your AAP Dashboard UI using your credentials.

. Re-sync the `Workshop Project` with your latest updates within the Ansible Automation Platform UI
+
** Navigate to **Automation Execution → Projects** and select `Workshop Project`
+
** On the top right, select the `Sync Project` button and wait for `Last job status` to provide the status of `Success`.

. Next, go to **Automation Execution → Templates**, click the **Create template** button, and choose **Create job template**.
+
. Fill out the following details:
+
|===
| Parameter                  | Value

| Name                       | Stop VMs
| Job type                   | Run
| Inventory                  | OpenShift Virtual Machines
| Project                    | Workshop Project
| Playbook                   | `manage_vm_playbook.yml`
| Execution environment      | Day2 EE
| Credentials                | OpenShift Credential
| Extra variables            | `vm_name: rhel9-vm1` +
                               `vm_namespace: vms-aap-day2` +
                               `task_file: stop_vm.yml`
|===
+
. Click **Create job template**.
+
. Once the Stop VMs Job Template is created, select the `Launch Template` button
on the top right corner to run the job.

=== Extending stop_vm.yml to Handle All VMs in a Namespace

While the ability to manage a specific VM is important, the real value of
automation lies in managing multiple VMs at scale. In this section, you'll
extend the functionality of the `stop_vm.yml` task file to handle all the
Virtual Machines that reside within the `vms-aap-day2` namespace and learn how
to use the debug task to understand the structure of the VM resource `vm_info`
to identify key fields required to create dynamic Ansible tasks.



. Head back to the VSCode editor to access the `stop_vm.yml` file
+
. Modify the existing `stop_vm.yml` content with the following:
+
----
---
- name: Get all VirtualMachines in the namespace
  redhat.openshift_virtualization.kubevirt_vm_info:
    namespace: "{{ vm_namespace }}"
  register: vm_info

- name: Debug the vm_info variable
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    var: vm_info

- name: Wait until the VirtualMachine is stopped
  redhat.openshift_virtualization.kubevirt_vm:
    name: "{{ item.metadata.name }}"
    namespace: "{{ item.metadata.namespace }}"
    run_strategy: Halted
    wait: true
  loop: "{{ vm_info.resources }}"
  loop_control:
    label: "{{ item.metadata.name }}"
  when: item.status.printableStatus != "Stopped"
----
+
Explanation of Key Fields:
+
* The `kubevirt_vm_info` module retrieves all VMs in the namespace.
* `metadata.name`: The name of the VirtualMachine.
* `metadata.namespace`: The namespace the VM belongs to.
* The `loop_control` option sets a label for each task iteration, showing the VM name (item.metadata.name) in the output. This makes the playbook output more readable and easier to debug.
* `status.printableStatus`: The current status of the VM (e.g., Stopped).
+
These key fields originate from the `vm_info` structure output provided by the
`ansible.builtin.debug` module. The structure looks as follows and is
abbreviated for easier viewing below.
+
----
changed: true
result:
  apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
  kind: VirtualMachine
  metadata:
    annotations:
      kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: >
        ...
    ...
    name: rhel9-vm1
    namespace: vms-aap-day2
  spec:
    ...
  status:
    ...
    printableStatus: Stopped
  ...
----
+
. After making and saving the changes, ensure you commit and push them to your Gitea repository.
+
. Head back to the AAP Dashboard UI, go to the **Automation Execution -> Templates**, select the `Stop VMs` Job Template and select the pencil icon `Edit template` to edit the template.
+
. Modify the existing `Stop VMs` Job Template by **removing** the following variable from the `Extra variables` section and selecting `Save job template` when finished.
+
----
vm_name: rhel9-vm1
----
+
. Re-run via the `Launch Template` button.
+
image::stop_vms_multiple.png[title='Stopping the VMs', link=self, window=blank]
+
. Head to the OpenShift UI dashboard, you can verify the VMs are stopped within the Virtualization -> Virtual Machines section.

=== Start VM Task

In this lab exercise, you will build on your knowledge of managing multiple VMs
by creating a task to start your VMs within the `vm_management` role. This task
will be added to the `tasks` directory in a file named `start_vm.yml`.

The following steps will guide you in creating the `start_vm.yml` file.

. Within your VSCode editor, right click `tasks` of the `vm_management` collection and create a New File labeled `start_vm.yml`
+
. Add the following content to the `start_vm.yml`
+
----
---
- name: Get all VirtualMachines in the namespace
  redhat.openshift_virtualization.kubevirt_vm_info:
    namespace: "{{ vm_namespace }}"
  register: vm_info

- name: Debug the vm_info variable
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    var: vm_info

- name: Start the VirtualMachines
  redhat.openshift_virtualization.kubevirt_vm:
    name: "{{ item.metadata.name }}"
    namespace: "{{ item.metadata.namespace }}"
    run_strategy: Always
    wait: true
  loop: "{{ vm_info.resources }}"
  loop_control:
    label: "{{ item.metadata.name }}"
  when: item.status.printableStatus != "Running"
----
+
. After making and saving the changes, ensure you commit and push them to your Gitea repository.

=== Create & Run Start VM Job Template with Ansible Automation Platform

To execute the `manage_vm_playbook.yml` within Ansible Automation Platform, create a Job Template as follows:

. Head to the AAP UI dashboard, navigate to **Automation Execution → Templates**, click the **Create template** button, and choose **Create job template**.
+
. Fill out the following details:
+
|===
| Parameter         | Value

| Name          | Start VMs
| Job Type      | Run
| Inventory     | OpenShift Virtual Machines
| Project       | Workshop Project
| Playbook      | `manage_vm_playbook.yml`
| Execution Environment | Day2 EE
| Credentials   | OpenShift Credential
| Extra variables            | `vm_namespace: vms-aap-day2` +
                               `task_file: start_vm.yml`
|===
+
. Click **Create job template**.
+
. Once the `Start VMs` Job Template is created, select the **Launch Template** button on the top right corner to run the job.
+
. Head to the OpenShift UI dashboard, you can verify the VMs are running within the **Virtualization -> Virtual Machines** section.

=== Restart VM Task

In this lab exercise, you will focus on managing multiple VMs by creating a task to reboot your VMs. This task will be added to the `tasks` directory in a file named `restart_vm.yml`.

The following steps will guide you in creating the `restart_vm.yml` file.

. Within your VSCode editor, right click `tasks` of the `vm_management` collection and create a New File labeled `restart_vm.yml`
+
. Add the following content to the `restart_vm.yml`
+
----
---
- name: Get all Virtual Machines in the namespace
  redhat.openshift_virtualization.kubevirt_vm_info:
    namespace: "{{ vm_namespace }}"
  register: vm_info

- name: Stop Running Virtual Machines
  redhat.openshift_virtualization.kubevirt_vm:
    name: "{{ item.metadata.name }}"
    namespace: "{{ item.metadata.namespace }}"
    run_strategy: Halted
    wait: true
  loop: "{{ vm_info.resources }}"
  loop_control:
    label: "{{ item.metadata.name }}"
  when: item.status.printableStatus == "Running"

- name: Refresh VM info after stopping
  redhat.openshift_virtualization.kubevirt_vm_info:
    namespace: "{{ vm_namespace }}"
  register: updated_vm_info

- name: Start the Virtual Machines
  redhat.openshift_virtualization.kubevirt_vm:
    name: "{{ item.metadata.name }}"
    namespace: "{{ item.metadata.namespace }}"
    run_strategy: Always
    wait: true
  loop: "{{ updated_vm_info.resources }}"
  loop_control:
    label: "{{ item.metadata.name }}"
  when: item.status.printableStatus != "Running"
----
+

**Explanation of Key Points**
+
* The `kubevirt_vm_info` module retrieves all VMs in the namespace. The first retrieval stores their initial state in `vm_info`. This is used to identify VMs that need to be stopped. After stopping, the second retrieval updates the VM state in `updated_vm_info`, ensuring accurate information is used for the subsequent start operation.
+
. After making and saving the changes, ensure you commit and push them to your Gitea repository.

=== Create & Run Restart VM Job Template with Ansible Automation Platform

To execute the `manage_vm_playbook.yml` within Ansible Automation Platform, create a Job Template as follows:

. Head to the AAP UI Dashboard, navigate to **Automation Execution → Templates**, click the **Create template** button, and choose **Create job template**.
+
. Fill out the following details:
+
|===
| Parameter         | Value

| **Name**          | Restart VMs
| **Job Type**      | Run
| **Inventory**     | OpenShift Virtual Machines
| **Project**       | Workshop Project
| **Playbook**      | `manage_vm_playbook.yml`
| **Execution Environment** | Day2 EE
| **Credentials**   | OpenShift Credential
| Extra variables            | `vm_namespace: vms-aap-day2` +
                               `task_file: restart_vm.yml`
|===
+
. Click **Create job template**.
+
. Once the `Restart VMs` Job Template is created, select the **Launch Template** button on the top right corner to run the job.
. Head to the OpenShift UI Dashboard to view the changes of the VMs.
