= Creating a Dynamic Inventory for OpenShift Virtual Machines


== Lab Overview
Dynamic inventories allow Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) to automatically
fetch and update the inventory of systems from external sources, eliminating
the need for manual inventory management.

In this lab, we will configure a dynamic inventory to pull data from OpenShift
Virtualization. This will enable AAP to manage OpenShift VMs residing in the
`vms-app-day2` namespace of an OCP cluster.

== Create an Inventory

. Navigate to **Automation Execution → Infrastructure → Inventories**.
+
. Select the **Create inventory** button.
+
. In the **Create Inventory** form:
   * Provide a name: `OpenShift Virtual Machines`.
   * Select `Default` as the Organization.
+
. Click the **Create inventory** button.
+

== Add a Source to the Inventory

. After creating the inventory, switch to the **Sources** tab.
+

+
. Select the **Create source** button.
+
. In the **Create Source** form:
   * Provide a name: `OpenShift Virtual Machines Source`.
   * Select `OpenShift Virtualization` as the **Source** type.
   * Choose `Default Execution Environment` as the execution environment.
   * Add the `OpenShift Credential` (Bearer Token was pre-created)
   * Select `Update on Launch` checkbox within Options.
   * Set `Cache timeout` to `0` seconds
+
. Click the **Create source** button to save the configuration.

==  Update the Inventory
. Launch the inventory update:
   * Click the **Launch Inventory Update** button in the top-right corner.
+

+
. Wait for the **Last Job Status** to show `Success`.

== Verify the Inventory
. Once the update completes successfully:
   * Click the **Back to Inventory Sources** button.
   * Switch to the **Hosts** tab.
+
. Confirm that the Virtual Machines from the `vms-app-day2` namespace of your OpenShift cluster are listed as inventory hosts.

== Test Connectivity of the Virtual Machines

In this lab, there will be three virtual machines running within your
OpenShift environment.

Ensure that you can ping those VMs
within the **AAP** dashboard {aap_controller_web_url} as follows:

. Login to the AAP Dashboard using the credentials provided in the `Setup` step.
+
. Navigate to Automation Execution -> Infrastructure -> Inventories
   * Select the `OpenShift Virtual Machines` Inventory
   * Within the Details page of the `OpenShift Virtual Machines` Inventory, select the *Hosts* tab.
+
. Select the 3 VMs and click the *Run command* button
   * Within the Run command Details, select the `ping` module and click *Next*.
   * Within the Run command Execution Environment, Select the *Day2 EE* execution environment and click *Next*.
   * Within the Run command Credential, select the pre-created *Workshop Credential* and click *Next*.
   * Within the Run command Review, select *Finish*.
+
. Verify Results: You should see a list of VMs along with their statuses similar to:
+
----
vms-aap-day2-rhel9-vm1 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
vms-aap-day2-rhel9-vm2 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
vms-aap-day2-rhel9-vm3 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
----

You may also confirm the VMs are running using the **OpenShift UI** dashboard {openshift_cluster_console_url}:

**Virtualization -> VirtualMachines** within the `vms-aap-day2` project.

== Conclusion
You have successfully created a dynamic inventory in Ansible Automation Platform
that reflects your OpenShift Virtual Machines. This inventory is now ready for
use in automation tasks.
