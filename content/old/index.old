= lb1969: Operations and Automation with OpenShift Virtualization

Welcome to this hands-on lab, where we dive into *Operations* for managing Virtual Machines (VMs) on *OpenShift Virtualization* using the *Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)*.
This lab is designed to equip you with the knowledge and tools to perform critical operational tasks, ensuring your virtualized workloads are efficiently managed and maintained.

== What You'll Learn

In this lab, we will cover the following key activities:

. *Lifecycle Management of VMs*: Learn how to stop, start, and restart Virtual Machines using the `redhat.openshift_virtualization` Ansible Collection.
. *Patching Security Updates*: Apply security updates to your VMs using the `dnf` Ansible module, ensuring systems stay secure and up to date.
. *Dynamic Inventory Management*: Discover how to dynamically add your OpenShift-hosted VMs into AAP, enabling automation that adapts to your changing infrastructure.
. *Backup and Restore of VMs*: Protect your workloads by creating and restoring backups of your Virtual Machines, ensuring data integrity and system resilience.

== Why This Lab Matters

As organizations scale and adopt OpenShift Virtualization, managing workloads efficiently becomes crucial.
This lab focuses on *Day 2 activities*, which include operations necessary to keep systems running smoothly, securely, and reliably.
Leveraging AAP allows you to standardize and automate these activities, reducing operational overhead and ensuring consistency.

By the end of this lab, you'll be proficient in automating common VM management tasks on OpenShift Virtualization using AAP, empowering you to streamline operations and focus on what matters most to your organization.
